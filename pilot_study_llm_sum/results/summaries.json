The bartender however,  rocked. The sangria was delicious and she helped us when our waitress would go Mia for extended periods of time.  I think this place could be good, it's just not there yet. They need help brewing,  they need to elevate their food and they definitely need a better waitress This review is in conjunction with the review last night, as I was with the party of 5 mentioned below. I thank the chef/owner for taking the time to respond. However, to be confronted outside of the restaurant (in front of other patrons we did not know) was extremely uncomfortable. I have never encountered a situation like this before at a restaurant. I have never even left a Yelp review before but this left me so unsettled. There was simply a guy waiting outside for us on the steps. He did not introduce himself & we were able to assume he was the chef because of his outfit. A polite, professional conversation would have been a game-changer. The chef offered to \"throw our food away\" and yes, he did offer a refund, but we had already left & paid, including tip. The service and waitresses were great; very friendly & nothing negative to state about them. There were only 3 LBC beers on tap. I would have liked to have seen more information about their brewing methods & more selections from LBC. I understand issues arise at times but again being confronted outside of a restaurant was extremely unsettling & nerve-wracking. I felt very put on the spot and left with a bad feeling. We went here now that it's Langhorne Brewing Company. The servers were great, and even warned us that it would be very loud when the band started (it was unbearably loud, I couldn't even hear the person next to me. But we were warned to be fair.) The beer was mediocre, nothing special. The food was pretty terrible and tasteless. I went with a party of 5 and no one enjoyed their meal. The only redeeming aspect was the pretzel we had as an appetizer, though even the \"beer cheese\" that came with it was pretty bland. Would not recommend.\n\nUpdate: Made the mistake of making this review as we were leaving and upon exiting the chef was waiting outside and verbally harassed us for the review which we found wildly unprofessional. I would have considered changing the review had someone come up to our table to discuss our concerns, not confront us in the parking lot. Wow what a disaster, will not return. This place was kinda dirty. There was gum stuck under the tables and the bathroom with disgusting leading me to believe the kitchen can't be much better. The food wasn't awful but the beer was. It was flat and tasted like it was brewed with a Mr. beer kit. It's a shame because this place has a lot of potential. Also, why would you have one waitress on the Saturday night? This is now called the Langhorne Brewing Company (LBC). I live around the corner and used to enjoy the restaurant when it was the OT. Haven't been back since it changed ownership as the reviews are pretty bleak. However we decided to give it a whirl with some friends last night. We waited about 15-20 minutes to have our drink and food orders taken. No biggie as we were not in a rush, we ordered bar food basics, sliders, fried pickles, truffle fries, cheesesteak egg rolls and the Trenton pie. The food was definitely edible despite what other reviewers state but nothing to rave about. The real disappointment was the beer, tried the LBC brown ale and IPA and they were very flat. Such a great concept and I would love to have a brewery this close to home but they are executing it poorly. Hoping they make improvements and would love to give it another shot in a couple months.... Had I a review a few months ago I would have given it 5 star for their Trenton thin crust pizza.  However the last few pizza's, the crust has been burnt.  Today we asked it light, not burnt.  Still we pick up a burnt pizza.  Truly wish they would go back to paying attention to when the pizza should be taken out of the oven cause previously the pizza was awesome. The sauce is delicious. Based on reviews, we gave it a shot. Wish we didn't. The food was sub par at best. My husband couldn't even eat his. Save your money and go elsewhere. pizza wass good but acoustics are horrible. main seating area is in the same room as the bar.  came for dinner 630 Friday night and couldnt hear each other talk across the table.  they are redoing in 2019, hope they address this.\n\nAnd then there's the profanity, by bar clientele when kids are in the seating area.  Mgt. doesn't seem to be in tune with it.\n\nrevised from 3 to 2 Finally got into check out the Old Neshaminy Inn this afternoon and we will most definitely  be back.  Tucked in between a shopping center and a development the inn sits back some on Maple Ave in Langhorne.  I'd be willing to bet that nkseverything from the breads used on the paninis to the salsa for the nachos was hand crafted from scratch.  Prices on par with any other service prompt and friendly.  Comfortable atmosphere with country music playing loud enough to hear but not too loud to interfere with conversation.  Our  nachos were crispy and adequately covered in shredded chicken and a delightful corn salsa.  The chicken cordon bleu that was supposed to come on a brioche bun - I requested as a panini instead and it has probably ruined me from getting a panini anywhere ever again. Probably one of the best paninis I have had anywhere.  Old  neshaminy inn definitely did not disappoint! New sign in front says: \"Langhorne Brewing Company.\" Please do not waste your time here so many other places with much better food and atmosphere.",

    "original_text": "Great food. Pick up fast. Kind staffs.\nI'd like to order again next time.\nand thank you for a fortune cookie Happy with the fast delivery, however, I can't understand the food, ordered garlic fried rice but received and unflavored oily fried rice. The worst is everything is overpriced. This spot is simply ok food not that fresh and oil seems to be re-used over and over. I went here when I was in the Temple area. Will not be back not worth the effort food is average to below. RULE OF THUMB: You can tell a lot about a Chinese Restaurant based on the amount of sauce packets they provide.\n\nIt's a simple concept: If the restaurant skimps on sauce packets in an effort to cut costs, this usually translates to other cost cutting measures. Most often in the form of poor service and food quality.\n\nYou can imagine my immediate disappointment when my latest order contained just 3 packets of both soy and duck sauce. This was an order for 4 people. \n\nThis used to be one of my \"go-to's\" so it pains me to say that the food quality and service has plunged to the point that I will not be returning. Hopefully, a decision maker at the establishment reads this and makes this place what it used to be. Because if they did, I would come back Delicious food, big portions and inexpensive!! This is my go to chinese spot in Philly. Really tasty. Big portions and cheap prices. Delicious pork roll and chicken was amazing. The only Chinese food place on campus that I eat from and that's actually decent. It's my go to place and I really love their dumplings My favorite on campus Chinese place! Their General Tso's Chicken is amazing and the dood in general has good quantity! If there was an option to give zero stars I would. I ordered sweet and sour chicken the delivery driver came within a reasonable time. However. When I got the bag in the house there was no sweet and sour sauce. I called the driver and restaurant and it took 30 minutes for them to deliver the sweet and sour sauce 7 blocks! I called the restaurant before the driver arrived with the sauce and said he can pick up the cold food that I no longer want. The manager on duty was extremely rude and told me there would be no refund I would need to bring the food to him. I reiterated that I told you to have your driver pick it up when he came with the sauce and you refused that offer. He then tried to give me credit on my next order (I will not order again). I was hung up on by the manager when I said that will not work please have your employee pick up the food or I can trash it but I need a refund. I called back and he insisted I bring the uneaten food back tomorrow after work. I have visited this place many times as it is near my house and cannot believe the way I was treated tonight. I wish I can give less than one star. I ordered from Grubhub because of cheap delivery fee. I ordered steamed shrimp with vegetables and on the description it says choice of sauce on the side.My food came  with brown sauce and the shrimp is lightly battered and fried.\n\nI agree with another reviewer saying that it is greasy. My order was supposed to be healthy but it's very greasy. Make sure you have a few drinks before eating. I love this place. Always does my meal just right and always timely",
    "gold_summary": "Mixed reviews highlight tasty, affordable food with large portions and fast delivery, especially dumplings and General Tso's chicken. However, complaints include greasy, bland dishes, reused oil, and high prices. Service problems such as rude staff, delayed missing items, and lack of refunds lower satisfaction. Few sauce packets suggest cost-cutting measures. While some customers remain loyal, many are disappointed. Improvement in food consistency and service is needed to regain trust.",

    "original_text": "Hands down- best bubble tea in town! Boba was perfect  definitely returning here again. Perfect place to go for any kind of tea. Baristas were incredibly nice and helpful for a first time boba customer! First Time Having The Peach & Mango Babo Also Had the Mango Smoothie Nd it was soo good Took my daughter and her friend to the Oxford valley mall and we were looking for a quick treat. A Yelp search, (I mean of course! LOL! ) Led us to this Mr. Wish location near the hmart in fairless hills. The girls were super excited to try this, I was just so glad we found a legitimate bubble tea place in the burbs and we didn't have to go to Chinatown or south Philly. There are locations in NE Philly as well, but this is now the closest to us. This location was clean, cute, and service was friendly. It's a little pricier than say Chinatown bakery prices but in line with other drink places like tea do, Kung fu tea, etc. The drinks were soo good! We all loved our selections, I tried the new lychee sunrise and may have thought it was soo good that I took it home and added some vodka... try it, you'll thank me  the little heart treats were also delish! Support local small businesses ya'll, definitely give this one a try! I heard there was a local bubble tea shop right by Hmart, so I had to go pay them a visit. They have a very diverse menu full of customizable options - a lot of teas, juices, toppings, hot/cold, sugar level, etc. As a self proclaimed bubble tea connoisseur, I was very pleased with my matcha milk bubble tea. The tapioca was perfectly chewy, and the drink was exactly as sweet as I liked it (50%). It was also cold out, so when I asked for less ice, they made sure not to top off my drink with too much ice.\n\nFrom what I observed, the employees were careful observing covid rules, and kept a clean space. There was a clear plastic barrier up at the counter, and a contactless payment device. Everyone is required to wear masks (including customers). \n\nWhen my friend and I went to pick up our our order one Saturday evening, it was pretty busy. I recommend calling in ahead of time. Our order was ready for pick up in 15 minutes, but it could have been longer depending on foot traffic. Great service! Will definitely be back. My son and I have been on a real boba kick lately. Having had him at work with me doing virtual schooling since August, were always looking for something new to try on our lunch break. I did a quick search for bubble tea near the office and Mr. Wish seemed to be the best option from what I saw online. I'm so glad we gave it a try! They had soo many amazing options, it was definitely hard to choose. My son had a matcha milk tea with added boba & I had the passion fruit green tea (also w. Boba). We were both really happy with our choices. My son said his matcha was sweet and tasty. My passion fruit tea included pulpy passion fruit seeds and I really enjoyed that addition. Can't wait to give them another try very soon! Great boba for bucks county. Worth trying for sure\n\nPersonally, I'd drive to Philly and go to a better establishment but if you are craving boba, nothing wrong with trying out Mr wish Love, Love, Love Mr. Wish! So happy to have a closer location near me and that they are continuously opening more locations. Their lemon black tea with boba is amazing. So refreshing that I practically get it every time I go. I truly feel anyone can find something they will love here. My dad is not a fan of bubble tea so he gets the strawberry fruit smoothies and thinks they are great! Highly recommend anyone getting out of their comfort zone and trying a drink! For this area, it's probably the best bubble tea option you'll find. The drinks aren't really consistent. I been there 3 times now.\n\nThe lychee punch - maybe they really didn't shake my drink well but the first 3 sips were just pure thick syrup. I swapped it something else but then they forgot my coconut jelly. \n\nThey do use syrups and real fruit - I don't see powder here. \n\nI think they can put less syrup here. I got the mixed fruit drink and it tasted reallt concentrated. The passionfruit was really strong. Lychee was also very overpowered with syrup too. Tapioca is okay. Not overcooked/soggy.\n\nI got the custard buns here - they should put more custard.\n\nSo for this town - it'll the best you'll find. This place compared to the other big brands out there - not the worst or top choices. I ordered the lychee sunrise and upon receiving, I was disappointed that it was a slush, it didn't appear to be so in the advertising poster. My disappointment soon disappeared as I sipped it and it was refreshing and not too sweet. And ample amount of aiyu jelly! The cocoa milk tea was a little grainy and still sweet enough, despite the fact that we asked for no added sugar. Tapioca balls were also well cooked and chewy.",
    "gold_summary": "Mr. Wish offers a diverse bubble tea menu with chewy tapioca, customizable sweetness, and fresh ingredients. Customers enjoy drinks like lychee sunrise and matcha milk tea, praising friendly service, cleanliness, and COVID safety. Some report inconsistent syrup levels, missing toppings, and occasional texture issues. Overall, it is considered a top bubble tea option locally, offering good value and convenience, especially compared to distant Chinatown locations. Many plan to return and recommend it to others.",

Definitely will be stopping by again in the next couple days! I stopped by on a whim one afternoon after the restaurant that I planned to visit was not yet open. I had never even heard of his restaurant, but apparently it's a silly stable and I should've tried a long time ago. I sat at the bar and had a couple of cocktails which were refreshing. We ordered the truffle gnocchi, grilled cheese, and Caesar salad. All of the dishes were excellent. The gnocchi was tasty comforting and very filling. The grilled cheese with super cheesy and paired well with the tomato soup, although I wish the sandwich was a bit larger. The Caesar salad was hands-down my favorite. It tasted incredibly fresh and delicious. I could taste all of the flavor in the dressing. I sat on the side of the bar where it was hard for the bartender to see me due to a large (espresso?) machine blocking me from view, but the bartender checked in often. Such a great experience! I'll definitely be back in the future. While in philly to visit family we stumbled on this upscale grocery store. Lots of option including wine. We just got a cup of coffee and water for our hotel room. I feel a calmness wash over me when I walk into Di Bruno Bros. The quality - of products, of service, of in-store displays - is unrivaled by any other market in the city.

    "original_text": "Best cheesesteak I ever had, without a doubt. Wow, just wow. Looked all over the city for something this good, definitely a hidden gem! This place is the most authentic steak and cheese I have ever had. First of all it's a really old restaurant and it  is a whole in the wall restaurant but that probably what makes it even better! This huge steak and cheese was the most flavorful thing I have ever had lol. You will not be disappointed. They have stopped serving pizza to focus on their mor popular items but its so worth it! Highly recommended! Heard good things about Mama's cheesesteak from a friend, who hailed it as his favorite - and now, it is on my Top 5! Mamas is unique- not your typical cheesesteak. What sets it apart is 2 things. First is the exorbitant amount of meat- they really pile on the steak. The meat is loosely chopped so you get tons of bite-sized steak slabs. And this thing is hefty unlike other steaks I've had in a while. The second standout aspect of Mamas is the cheese. It's their \"house blend\" cheese. Although I don't know the secret blend recipe, it tastes something like provolone, American white and mozzarella.. and it is amazing. Piled in high like the meat, this gooey cheese adds tons of goodness to the sandwich. It's cheesy, it's juicy, it's flavorful, and it's between two soft pillowy buns. And because it's so cheesy - it's unlike any other cheesesteak I've had before. Any true cheesesteak lover needs to pay Mama's a visit. Quick story. Iwas at the doctors office getting a checkup for high blood pressure when the doctor told me she just left a patient who couldn't stop talking about this place. The way she described his excitement about it made me very curious. As a cheesesteak aficionado I have a duty to review this place. \n\nFirst off I came in on a weekday at 11am. The parking lot is pretty tiny. Be careful when exiting as cars are zooming when you exit the lot and your view to the left is obscured by foliage. I would say this is the biggest negative to the place. The inside of the restaurant is pretty small and old fashioned. There was a sign on the door that said no indoor dining but tables seemed to be available with no demarcation on them. I would still assume there's no indoor dining allowed though. I ordered a full sized cheesesteak with no add ons. I think this might have been my mistake as I will explain later on. The bread was probably the best I've had on a cheesesteak. Perfect combination of crisp and soft which was so easy to eat and held everything together. Their housemade cheese mix also seemed to be good and gave the sandwich some flavor. It was well coated over the steak with no skimping. Now the one negative I had was the steak. Great texture but had zero flavor. I literally didn't taste anything on the meat. I guess I assumed there would be some sort of seasoning. It was sad to feel like I may have had the perfect cheesesteak if I had some add ons like salt/pepper, onions, or hot peppers. Next time I will definitely get some sort of add ons. As far as pricing this more expensive than a typical cheesesteak. I believe it was $16+. It was pretty dense and heavy though but I also could have eaten it all in one sitting. All in all very good experience. My favorite cheesesteak on the main line. There is a unique flavor to Mama's proprietary cheese blend that really sets the sandwich apart from their competitors. It's also worth noting that the potions are huge. So, if you are just eating for one, a half sandwich will be more than enough. Highly recommend. The most decadent cheesy cheesesteak you are going to find anywhere..\nThis steak is huge and it literally weighs a ton. \nAll are made to order so you will wait a bit but its worth it. Not any different than you will get inside Philly \nDelicious. As good as you are going to find on outskirts of Philly proper. \nDefinitely worth the trip for any true Cheesesteak connoisseur. When in Philly, you should eat a cheesesteak. That's all anyone talks about and that's all anyone refers me to. But for a long time I had to be gluten-free. So I would politely smile and nod while people went on and on about these magical cheesesteaks. Until yesterday. I have been slowly reworking gluten into my body, like an athlete training for a marathon. And I was taken to what I can only imagine true Philadelphians know of: Mama's. It's a small joint, with not a lot of markings or distinctive unique pieces that restaurants often do when they're trying to compensate. Nothing to compensate for here. I ordered the cheesesteak with sauce. The sauce is like a marinara sauce but calling it that still isn't quite justice. I came home and took the first bite, the bread melting in my mouth and the cheese filling up every sense, and the meat diced in a perfect delicious way, that I truly have not raved about a piece of food in I don't even know how long! This sandwich is the tits! As soon as I consumed it, more like inhaled it, I could've easily eaten more. We got the minis because apparently the regular size ones are the size of a human baby, and I'm glad. But the taste of it lingered and I woke up this morning still thinking about it. I'm really glad I don't live near there or I would be the size of a house because I would have no shame in getting at least one every day for the rest of my life. Am I over selling it? I doubt it. I just know that it is the holy grail and I will be back. I'm not sure if it's Covid but it's hit or miss on this place ... not sure when they are open or closed.  The food is good and portioned well but very pricey. I would say not worth the price. There other places I can go that provide just as much food for less money. Very good cheesesteaks. The steaks are of great size, have unreal flavor, and a lot of cheese (Great for all you cheese lovers!). The small, local restaurant atmosphere with loyal customers makes Mama's the type of establishment I love. \n\nWarning: the only thing I will say is that the cheesesteaks are pricey as it was around $30 for 2. \n\nI know it can be a few dollars more than some other cheesesteak places, but Mama's is an experience and experiences are more valuable than a couple of bucks. \n\nI would recommend trying Mamas out. Not bad....not bad. I heard so much about Mama's pizzeria and I'm glad I got the chance to check them out being as tho they were closed the first two attempts. I guess third times the charm.\n\nI came to mama's pizzeria and the line was pretty long but it moved fast and everyone practiced social distancing.\n\nI ordered my cheesesteak and I believe I paid 15.00 for my sandwich. It was worth it cause it was definitely a hefty cheesesteak! When I first tried it, I was confused with their choices of cheese. I think they have their signature 3 cheese blend however everyone knows american is the best cheese for a cheesesteak.\n\nThe more I ate it.. The more we got acquainted the cheesesteak and I. It was flavorful and the bread was tasty. Overall I learned to adapt my taste buds to this unique cheesesteak and I'll definitely check out mama's pizzeria again! The most decadent cheesy cheesesteak you are going to find anywhere. Best meaty cheesesteak around!!!!!",
    "gold_summary": "Offers a top-tier authentic cheesesteak known for its large portions of tender steak and a distinctive three-cheese blend. The bread is well-textured, complementing the juicy, flavorful sandwich. Though pricier than average and with limited parking, its unique taste and hearty servings make it a must-visit for cheesesteak lovers. Some find the steak under-seasoned without add-ons, but overall, the rich cheese and meat balance deliver a highly recommended indulgence.",
