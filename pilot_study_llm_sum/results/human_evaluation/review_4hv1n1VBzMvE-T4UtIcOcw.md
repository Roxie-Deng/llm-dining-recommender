## Original Review
If you want freshly grated parmesan or pecorino cheeses, this is a great place to get it. The staff is always helpful and willing to fill your order to your specifications. Their gift boxes however are overpriced. As a recipient of their gifts on a number of occasions, I couldn't believe how much they cost when you consider the contents of the boxes. In my opinion, it should be 50% less! At first we were disappointed there was no open seating downstairs, but then we realized there is a restaurant upstairs which was fantastic! The pizza and salad were both delicious. We also got some sandwiches downstairs to go which were also very high quality While some people find neighborhood bars to frequent, I found Di Bruno's.

If you're like me where heaven includes free-flowing cured meats and cheese, this will be your new favorite spot.

Notes: Incredibly friendly and helpful staff, amazing spot for lunch, picnic ingredients, butcher.

What to get: Abruzze spread, Daily fresh-made baguettes, Chorizo Ib√©rico, curry chicken salad Excellent muffins and pastries. The almond croissant and pumpkin Muffin were phenomenal. Perfect place to grab a quick breakfast. make sure u ask how much something cost b4 u buy it mini chocolate coconut macaroons cost $30 pound when u ask the manager to make sure the info was wrong he confirm its true I told him I rather buy lobster for that kind of money it's just cookies what's in it caviar told him find find another sucker glad I ask b4 I order this place overpriced anyway plenty nice gourmet grocery that sell same thing 4 moderate price the cooked whole roastissurrie chicken is $11 everywhere else $6 to $8 c my Point Went home with this avocado... cut into it only to see it was beyond rotten and was covered in mold. The worst part is there was a whole bin of avocados with this exact same softness - so I know a number of others went home and had the same experience. I mean, this must have been sitting for a WHILE, which says a lot about how often they're clearing out and replacing produce.... Great neighborhood stop for gourmet groceries when working and staying close by, fresh produce, bakery, cheese, wine, a great selection of heat and eat's and grab and go's! Definitely will be stopping by again in the next couple days! I stopped by on a whim one afternoon after the restaurant that I planned to visit was not yet open. I had never even heard of his restaurant, but apparently it's a silly stable and I should've tried a long time ago. I sat at the bar and had a couple of cocktails which were refreshing. We ordered the truffle gnocchi, grilled cheese, and Caesar salad. All of the dishes were excellent. The gnocchi was tasty comforting and very filling. The grilled cheese with super cheesy and paired well with the tomato soup, although I wish the sandwich was a bit larger. The Caesar salad was hands-down my favorite. It tasted incredibly fresh and delicious. I could taste all of the flavor in the dressing. I sat on the side of the bar where it was hard for the bartender to see me due to a large (espresso?) machine blocking me from view, but the bartender checked in often. Such a great experience! I'll definitely be back in the future. While in philly to visit family we stumbled on this upscale grocery store. Lots of option including wine. We just got a cup of coffee and water for our hotel room. I feel a calmness wash over me when I walk into Di Bruno Bros. The quality - of products, of service, of in-store displays - is unrivaled by any other market in the city. A must-visit for your entertaining needs (or to treat yourself to one of the other many deliciousness drinks + to-go items). Super clean and abiding by COVID rules Anti-police owners. I would never patronize this place again.
