## Original Review
Greek salad with salmon and lemon vinaigrette was delicious. The food is always consistent. Pizza, salads, soups are already great. Chicken and waffle bites app is awesome. Onion rings are very good. Quesadillas do not disappoint. Salads always fresh and always flexible to your toppings. If you are picky with burgers or crab cakes, just tell them want you want and you will be pleased. Always accommodating. This place is a gem. I recommend to my "foodie" friends and they aren't disappointed either. We came on Friday to support our friend who is a musician.  There 4 in our party and friends scattered throughout the bar seating area.  Thank goodness my friend does not play loud or everyone would have left deaf. There is nothing between you and the band playing by the fireplace.  The beer is meh. None of us drank their brewed beer after sampling. Compared to all the breweries in bucks, they are nowhere near as good. The food was meh. I had chicken nachos which were burnt and covered in jar salsa. The chicken was tasty but it is cut in long strips on one side of the nachos. Impossible to have in every bite. I ordered the margarita pizza. I eat this pizza everywhere we go and this was the least favorite.  It had canned crushed tomatoes,  no basil and one glop of mozzarella at the end of each slice. I normally discuss my opinion with the waitstaff for no other reason but to not trash a place without giving a fair shot, but our waitress was so slow and so not on the ball, I would probably still be there waiting for a resolution.  The bartender however,  rocked. The sangria was delicious and she helped us when our waitress would go Mia for extended periods of time.  I think this place could be good, it's just not there yet. They need help brewing,  they need to elevate their food and they definitely need a better waitress This review is in conjunction with the review last night, as I was with the party of 5 mentioned below. I thank the chef/owner for taking the time to respond. However, to be confronted outside of the restaurant (in front of other patrons we did not know) was extremely uncomfortable. I have never encountered a situation like this before at a restaurant. I have never even left a Yelp review before but this left me so unsettled. There was simply a guy waiting outside for us on the steps. He did not introduce himself & we were able to assume he was the chef because of his outfit. A polite, professional conversation would have been a game-changer. The chef offered to "throw our food away" and yes, he did offer a refund, but we had already left & paid, including tip. The service and waitresses were great; very friendly & nothing negative to state about them. There were only 3 LBC beers on tap. I would have liked to have seen more information about their brewing methods & more selections from LBC. I understand issues arise at times but again being confronted outside of a restaurant was extremely unsettling & nerve-wracking. I felt very put on the spot and left with a bad feeling. We went here now that it's Langhorne Brewing Company. The servers were great, and even warned us that it would be very loud when the band started (it was unbearably loud, I couldn't even hear the person next to me. But we were warned to be fair.) The beer was mediocre, nothing special. The food was pretty terrible and tasteless. I went with a party of 5 and no one enjoyed their meal. The only redeeming aspect was the pretzel we had as an appetizer, though even the "beer cheese" that came with it was pretty bland. Would not recommend.

Update: Made the mistake of making this review as we were leaving and upon exiting the chef was waiting outside and verbally harassed us for the review which we found wildly unprofessional. I would have considered changing the review had someone come up to our table to discuss our concerns, not confront us in the parking lot. Wow what a disaster, will not return. This place was kinda dirty. There was gum stuck under the tables and the bathroom with disgusting leading me to believe the kitchen can't be much better. The food wasn't awful but the beer was. It was flat and tasted like it was brewed with a Mr. beer kit. It's a shame because this place has a lot of potential. Also, why would you have one waitress on the Saturday night? This is now called the Langhorne Brewing Company (LBC). I live around the corner and used to enjoy the restaurant when it was the OT. Haven't been back since it changed ownership as the reviews are pretty bleak. However we decided to give it a whirl with some friends last night. We waited about 15-20 minutes to have our drink and food orders taken. No biggie as we were not in a rush, we ordered bar food basics, sliders, fried pickles, truffle fries, cheesesteak egg rolls and the Trenton pie. The food was definitely edible despite what other reviewers state but nothing to rave about. The real disappointment was the beer, tried the LBC brown ale and IPA and they were very flat. Such a great concept and I would love to have a brewery this close to home but they are executing it poorly. Hoping they make improvements and would love to give it another shot in a couple months.... Had I a review a few months ago I would have given it 5 star for their Trenton thin crust pizza.  However the last few pizza's, the crust has been burnt.  Today we asked it light, not burnt.  Still we pick up a burnt pizza.  Truly wish they would go back to paying attention to when the pizza should be taken out of the oven cause previously the pizza was awesome. The sauce is delicious. Based on reviews, we gave it a shot. Wish we didn't. The food was sub par at best. My husband couldn't even eat his. Save your money and go elsewhere. pizza wass good but acoustics are horrible. main seating area is in the same room as the bar.  came for dinner 630 Friday night and couldnt hear each other talk across the table.  they are redoing in 2019, hope they address this.

And then there's the profanity, by bar clientele when kids are in the seating area.  Mgt. doesn't seem to be in tune with it.

revised from 3 to 2 Finally got into check out the Old Neshaminy Inn this afternoon and we will most definitely  be back.  Tucked in between a shopping center and a development the inn sits back some on Maple Ave in Langhorne.  I'd be willing to bet that nkseverything from the breads used on the paninis to the salsa for the nachos was hand crafted from scratch.  Prices on par with any other service prompt and friendly.  Comfortable atmosphere with country music playing loud enough to hear but not too loud to interfere with conversation.  Our  nachos were crispy and adequately covered in shredded chicken and a delightful corn salsa.  The chicken cordon bleu that was supposed to come on a brioche bun - I requested as a panini instead and it has probably ruined me from getting a panini anywhere ever again. Probably one of the best paninis I have had anywhere.  Old  neshaminy inn definitely did not disappoint! New sign in front says: "Langhorne Brewing Company." Please do not waste your time here so many other places with much better food and atmosphere.

## Reference Summary
Offers tasty dishes like Greek salad and chicken bites with friendly staff and flexible options. Food quality is inconsistent, beer is poor, and live music is very loud, making conversation difficult. Cleanliness and service issues exist. A customer confrontation outside after a negative review felt unprofessional. Potential is there but improvements are needed.
