## Original Review
Hands down- best bubble tea in town! Boba was perfect  definitely returning here again. Perfect place to go for any kind of tea. Baristas were incredibly nice and helpful for a first time boba customer! First Time Having The Peach & Mango Babo Also Had the Mango Smoothie Nd it was soo good Took my daughter and her friend to the Oxford valley mall and we were looking for a quick treat. A Yelp search, (I mean of course! LOL! ) Led us to this Mr. Wish location near the hmart in fairless hills. The girls were super excited to try this, I was just so glad we found a legitimate bubble tea place in the burbs and we didn't have to go to Chinatown or south Philly. There are locations in NE Philly as well, but this is now the closest to us. This location was clean, cute, and service was friendly. It's a little pricier than say Chinatown bakery prices but in line with other drink places like tea do, Kung fu tea, etc. The drinks were soo good! We all loved our selections, I tried the new lychee sunrise and may have thought it was soo good that I took it home and added some vodka... try it, you'll thank me  the little heart treats were also delish! Support local small businesses ya'll, definitely give this one a try! I heard there was a local bubble tea shop right by Hmart, so I had to go pay them a visit. They have a very diverse menu full of customizable options - a lot of teas, juices, toppings, hot/cold, sugar level, etc. As a self proclaimed bubble tea connoisseur, I was very pleased with my matcha milk bubble tea. The tapioca was perfectly chewy, and the drink was exactly as sweet as I liked it (50%). It was also cold out, so when I asked for less ice, they made sure not to top off my drink with too much ice.

From what I observed, the employees were careful observing covid rules, and kept a clean space. There was a clear plastic barrier up at the counter, and a contactless payment device. Everyone is required to wear masks (including customers). 

When my friend and I went to pick up our our order one Saturday evening, it was pretty busy. I recommend calling in ahead of time. Our order was ready for pick up in 15 minutes, but it could have been longer depending on foot traffic. Great service! Will definitely be back. My son and I have been on a real boba kick lately. Having had him at work with me doing virtual schooling since August, were always looking for something new to try on our lunch break. I did a quick search for bubble tea near the office and Mr. Wish seemed to be the best option from what I saw online. I'm so glad we gave it a try! They had soo many amazing options, it was definitely hard to choose. My son had a matcha milk tea with added boba & I had the passion fruit green tea (also w. Boba). We were both really happy with our choices. My son said his matcha was sweet and tasty. My passion fruit tea included pulpy passion fruit seeds and I really enjoyed that addition. Can't wait to give them another try very soon! Great boba for bucks county. Worth trying for sure

Personally, I'd drive to Philly and go to a better establishment but if you are craving boba, nothing wrong with trying out Mr wish Love, Love, Love Mr. Wish! So happy to have a closer location near me and that they are continuously opening more locations. Their lemon black tea with boba is amazing. So refreshing that I practically get it every time I go. I truly feel anyone can find something they will love here. My dad is not a fan of bubble tea so he gets the strawberry fruit smoothies and thinks they are great! Highly recommend anyone getting out of their comfort zone and trying a drink! For this area, it's probably the best bubble tea option you'll find. The drinks aren't really consistent. I been there 3 times now.

The lychee punch - maybe they really didn't shake my drink well but the first 3 sips were just pure thick syrup. I swapped it something else but then they forgot my coconut jelly. 

They do use syrups and real fruit - I don't see powder here. 

I think they can put less syrup here. I got the mixed fruit drink and it tasted reallt concentrated. The passionfruit was really strong. Lychee was also very overpowered with syrup too. Tapioca is okay. Not overcooked/soggy.

I got the custard buns here - they should put more custard.

So for this town - it'll the best you'll find. This place compared to the other big brands out there - not the worst or top choices. I ordered the lychee sunrise and upon receiving, I was disappointed that it was a slush, it didn't appear to be so in the advertising poster. My disappointment soon disappeared as I sipped it and it was refreshing and not too sweet. And ample amount of aiyu jelly! The cocoa milk tea was a little grainy and still sweet enough, despite the fact that we asked for no added sugar. Tapioca balls were also well cooked and chewy.

## Reference Summary
Mr. Wish offers a diverse bubble tea menu with chewy tapioca, customizable sweetness, and fresh ingredients.
